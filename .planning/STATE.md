## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Thread safety via locking (not connection pooling) — simpler, lower risk for MCP use case
- Init: Qualified name resolution in indexer — align with graph layer which already uses qualified names
- Init: Scope to Critical + High only — issues that cause wrong data or crashes; tech debt deferred
- [Phase 01-critical-safety]: Thread safety via threading.Lock (not RLock) — no method calls another self.method while holding the lock; inline auto-commit to avoid deadlock
- [Phase 01-critical-safety]: execute() uses double-check pattern: check conn outside lock, call open() which acquires lock, then re-enter lock for execute — avoids deadlock with non-reentrant lock
- [Phase 01-02]: _validate_path uses resolve().relative_to() not is_absolute() alone — handles symlinks and .. traversal uniformly
- [Phase 01-02]: Empty/None file_path returns None from _validate_path (no error) — downstream handles not-found semantics
- [Phase 01-02]: analyze_dataflow returns dict error, other tools return str error — matches each tool's existing error convention
- [Phase 02-data-integrity]: Qualified keys use 'rel_path::symbol_name' format — consistent with graph layer; secondary index _name_to_qualified enables O(1) callee resolution; inject_cached() no longer touches _definitions
- [Phase 02-data-integrity]: except Exception (not BaseException): MemoryError is subclass of Exception in Python 3 — catches all standard crashes while preserving KeyboardInterrupt/SystemExit
- [Phase 02-data-integrity]: Crashing file kept in _index with has_errors=True and skeleton=[] — consistent with syntax error convention, allows callers to detect and report the problem
